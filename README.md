# MovieProject

You can search for movies and you can see movie list based on few category.

I have followed MVVM(Model-View-ViewModel) pattern in this project. Here, UIViewController does all the logic part of UI related and its own an object of its associated ViewModel. ViewModel does all the work using/via Model and update the UI if necessary.
